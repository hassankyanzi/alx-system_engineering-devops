### Steps followed to use sftp
* I used the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. I needed the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.
* Once connected, I navigated to the directory where I wanted to upload the screenshots.
* put -r /home/hassankyanzi/Desktop/command_line_for_the_win
* I uploaded the folder then used ls to see the new contents of the folder.
* I connected again to the sand box but now with ssh to enable me use git to push the new directory to the github repository.

### Environment
